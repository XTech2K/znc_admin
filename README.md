### Registering with the COS IRC Network

1. Register a username [here](http://107.170.134.161:5000)

* Note: This username should ideally be registered (or available to register) with the NickServ on IRC.  This is how your name will be displayed, so **make it something logical!!!**

1.  Login to IRC using the client of your choice. We will be adding a KIWI client shortly.  Pointing your IRC client to the ZNC bouncer is different based on the client.

    |Limechat|  |
    |-------|-------|
    |Network name: | anything you want!|
    |server:| 107.170.134.161|
    |port:| 5001|
    |SSL:| yes|

    Nickname and Login name should be what you chose.
    Server password is what you chose
    Nickserv Password: Password you gave to Nickserv. Leave blank if you have not registered with it yet.

    Other clients (including KIWI):
    /serverÂ 107.170.134.161 +5001 username:password

    If you have registered, you should login with Nickserv

1. Join channels like so:

    /join #cos

1. Configure your settings via the webadmin interface. Here you can add channels other than #cos to be bounced.
