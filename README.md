### Registering with the COS IRC Network

1. Register a username [here](http://107.170.134.161:5000)
    * Note: This username should ideally be registered (or available to register) with the NickServ on IRC.  This is how your name will be displayed, so **make it something logical!!!**

2. Log in [here](http://107.170.134.161:7778/), using the Nick and password you just registered.

3. Chat away!!!  It's recommended to bookmark these links!

    * Join channels like so:

        `/join #cos`

    * You can create channels with any name you like!  (If you aren't familiar with IRC, channels function just like chat rooms.)

        `/join #my_really_cool_new_channel_name!`

    * You can configure your settings via the webadmin interface. Here you can add channels other than #cos to be bounced.
        * *What does that mean??*  It means while you're not actively logged into an IRC channel, ZNC will be logged in for you, and will give you a history of messages you missed while not logged in.  It's pretty cool!
        * [Web admin console](https://107.170.134.161:5001)

    * Register your nick with Freenode's NickServ. This username will belong reserved for you on the freenode network

        /msg NickServ <password> <email>

###Alternate Configurations

*  Login to IRC using the client of your choice.  Pointing your IRC client to the ZNC bouncer is different based on the client.
