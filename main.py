"""SockJS Twisted Server

This server will wait for incoming connections on Localhost:4000,
take the user information sent to it, and then validate the username
with ZNC.

If the username has not been taken already, it will add the new user.

Due to security issues, and also for the sake of modularity, this script
has been made so that it can work with any ZNC server.  You can also
modify the IP address where your ZNC server is running.  See below.

To run the script:
    $ main.py <admin username> <admin password>

and in a separate terminal window to run the Flask app:
    $ app.py
